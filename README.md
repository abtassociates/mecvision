# MECVision
The MEC Vision web-app is a Progressive Web App ([PWA]) prototype coding project that uses computer vision (object detection in this case) on mosquito trap papers (ovitraps) to estimate the number of mosquito eggs on that ovitrap, using computer vision.

This project uses [OpenCV.js], [Vue.js], [Vuetify], and [Vue Croppa] technologies, and used the [TodoMVC] PWA as a template for its codebase.

MECVision was aided in being made possible by the generous support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and is implemented under the [Zika AIRS Project](https://www.usaid.gov/documents/1862/zika-airs-project-zap). The information on this website and web app does not necessarily represent the views of USAID or the United States Government.
